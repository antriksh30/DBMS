## PROBLEM 1
### AIM:
To study DDL and DML commands
##
DDL commands change the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table,altering a table, etc. All the commands of DDL are auto-committed, which means it permanently saves all the changes in the database. Some DDL commands are :-
### 1) CREATE: It is used to create a new table in the database.
<pre>
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE[,….]);
</pre>
### 2) DROP: It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
<pre>
DROP TABLE table_name;
</pre>
### 3) ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
<pre>
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;
</pre>
### 4) TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
<pre>
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
</pre>
##
DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all forms of changes in the database. DML commands are not auto-committed, which means it can’t permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rolled back.
### 1) INSERT: INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
<pre>
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (col1, col2, ….cols) VALUES (value1, ...vals);
</pre>
### 2) UPDATE: This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
<pre>
UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1=value1,…column_nameN=valueN] [WHERE CONDITION];
</pre>
### 3) DELETE: It is used to remove one or more rows from a table.
<pre>
DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
</pre>
