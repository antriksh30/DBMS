## PROBLEM 2
### AIM:
To study TCL and DCL commands
##
DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from any database user. Here are some commands that come under DCL: Grant, Revoke
### 1) 1)	Grant: It is used to give user access privileges to a database.
<pre>
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE TO SOME_USER, ANOTHER_USER;
</pre>
### 2) 2)	Revoke: It is used to take back permissions from the user.
<pre>
REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1, USER2;
</pre>
##
TCL commands can only be used with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only. These operations are automatically committed in the database thatâ€™s why they cannot be used while creating tables or dropping them. Here are some commands that come under TCL: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
### 1) Commit: Commit command is used to save all the transactions to the database.

### 2) Rollback: Rollback command is used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.

### 3) SAVEPOINT: It is used to roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.
<pre>
SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME;
</pre>
